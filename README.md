# Simulation-Based-Optimal-Control-Methods
This project explores optimal control through LQR tuning and simulation-based optimization methods. It includes applications such as control gain selection for dynamic systems and constrained resource extraction using direct methods.

## Simulation-Based Optimal Control – SYSE 511

This repository contains MATLAB implementations and LaTeX writeups for two optimal control tasks:  
1. **LQR Design** – Includes gain tuning, pole analysis, rise-time targeting, and finite-horizon Riccati integration (Parts a–d).  
2. **Nonlinear Resource Extraction** – Solves a constrained optimal control problem using direct optimization with control discretization and state simulation.
